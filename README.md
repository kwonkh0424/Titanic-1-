# Titanic
        ** Note:Tese files are developed and tested in Python Version 3.7

Purpose: Finding a machine learning model that effectively predicts survival of Titanic passangers.
 
Following packages are required to run the code:
 - Jupyter Notebook
 - Numpy
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn
 - Operator
 - Pandas
 - Sklearn
 - Scipy

There are two Jupyther Notebook Python files (ipynb):
 1. 'titanic.ipynb': This is archieve file for the older version of the algorithm
 2. 'titanic_updated.ipynb': This is updated version of the titanic.ipynb file

Required Input files:
 -'train.csv': used to train a model
 -'gender.csv': contains target feature 'Survived'
 -'test.csv': used to test a model

Output:
 - Data visualization of various features that affects survival rate of the passagners
 - Prediction models using various different machine learning methods
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Neighbors Classifier
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Neural Network (MLP)
